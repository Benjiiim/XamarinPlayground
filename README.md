### The Challenge
In this challenge, you will use one of the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to bring intelligence in a Xamarin-based cross-platform application.

The goal is to use the Emotion API to get your happiness percentage after getting a picture of you with the device/emulator camera.

The walkthrough below should help you with the callenge, but you can also get in touch with @benjiiim or @aspenwilder with questions--both of whom are on site at Evolve and happy to help!

The walkthrough has been written with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (with Xamarin tools installed) but should work in a similar way with Xamarin Studio.

### Challenge Walkthrough

* Get a Cognitive Service Emotion API trial key through the Cognitive Service website
* Create a Android blank project in Visual Studio 2015 with updates and Xamarin setup
* Create a shared project with the logic to call the Cognitive Service API
* Write (copy/paste) the code for the UI layer to get the camera stream, take a picture and send the stream to the shared code

##### Bonus Challenge #1 Walkthrough
* Create a Windows UWP project in the same solution
* Write (copy/paste) the code for the UI layer to get the camera stream, take a picture and send the stream to the shared code
